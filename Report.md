In our study, we were given a total of 15 schools with a total of 39,170 students.
A summary for our information is here.

In our study we will analyze the average of students in mathematics, reading and both together. And we will see if there is an impact on the results, the type of school, the budget per student and the number of students. If they influence, how do they influence?

*Does the school budget for the student affect the quality of the performance?

No, in the table "Spending Ranges (per Student) we see that schools that spend <$ 585 have better results. We can even say that with the increase in income we have a decrease in results.

*Does School Size affect school performance?

Referring to the "Scores by School Size" table, we see that large schools (2000-5000 students) have a passing rate of 50-60%, while in small schools we have a passing rate of more than 90%
So we can say that the fewer students we have, the higher the performance.

*Does the type of school affect it?

Referring to the table of the school types.
Yes, we can say that Charter School is much better than District School.

** From the data extracted for each school based on classes, we cannot say that there is a big impact on the specific school year because these data are very close from year to year and there is no correlation between them.
